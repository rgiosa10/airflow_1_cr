## Description

This repo showcases work with Airflow to leverage a DAG for automation of the below steps:
* Extracts the data from the csv file
* From the World Happiness Report data, creates a Python dictionary that has the country names as keys, and the overall rank for that country as the value.
* Generates three JSON files with a randomly selected country and its rank from the dictionary.
* Then uses the three choices to create three Python operator tasks that run simultaneously. It leverages a python_callable to call a function that prints a string using the country name and its happiness ranking in a sentence.
